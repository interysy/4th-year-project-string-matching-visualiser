# Requirement Gathering Workshop on 02/10/23 
 
## Goals & Objectives 
There are several objectives for this workshop, these include: 
- determining what features potential stakeholders would like to see within the product and why (what is helpful, what would make use easier etc.) 
- determining what the product should look like in order to make it as simple to use as possible, but also (hopefully) keeping it novel
- possibly generate new ideas on features and visuals
- help to get a sense of proprity of features (determine my Minimum Viable Product)
 
The main reason for having the workshop is to ensure the product is something that will actually be useful, as the project is quite open.  

## Who will be attending 
The plan is to have a mix of students from a range of backgrounds. I have recruited students with CS background who have already been introduced to string matching algorithms, ones with CS background that are yet to be introduced to these algorithms, as well as students with no technical background. The total number of students is 6.
 
## Workshop Agenda
_The length of the workshop is 1 hour. Everyone will receive a copy._  

The workshop will mainly consis of discussion of what the product should have and their proritisation. 
 
1. *(5 mins)* Introduction to what the project is (via a slidedeck). Ensuring everyone understands purpose and giving the opportunity for them to drop out if they would like. Agenda is also discussed here. 
2. *(20 mins)* Feature analysis via wiframes -  Show each wireframe in turn [refer here](https://github.com/interysy/4th-year-project-string-matching-visualiser/issues/6). For each:
    - explain what features are included  
    - ask everyone in turn what they like about it (what stands out)
    - ask everyone in turn if there is anything missing that would make it better - why?
    - is there anything that you would change and if so for what
    - each feature mentioned as a standout - ask about how important it is for them to have it
3. *(10 minutes)* Case Study Analysis - ask about the different ways the product will be used (this will help determine functional and non-functional requirements)
4. *(5 mins)* Debriefing - thanks for time 
 
10 minutes left free allowing for agenda points to overrun if necessary.
