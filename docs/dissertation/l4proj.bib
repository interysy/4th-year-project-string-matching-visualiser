abstract = {Text processing has moved beyond merely word processing and desktop publishing softwares, which currently form a miniscule part of its application. With the advent of the internet and the huge amount of text processing associated with information mining, string search algorithms have gained importance. In this paper a new string searching algorithm is presented that uses intelligent predictions based on text features to search for a string in a text. The proposed algorithm has been developed after analyzing the existing algorithms such as KMP, Boyer-Moore and Horspool. One unique feature of this algorithm is that unlike the existing algorithms, it does not require pre-processing the pattern to be searched. As a result it does not incur the overhead required in pre-processing the pattern. The algorithm searches through a given text to find the first occurrence of a pattern. It does not involve complex computations and uses simple rules during a match or mismatch of a pattern character. Based on the variety of applications coming up in areas of data and information mining, sentiment analysis, DNA pattern matching etc, this simple, elegant and intelligent algorithm will find its application.}

abstract={At numerous phases of the computational process, pattern matching is essential. It enables users to search for specific DNA subsequences or DNA sequences in a database. In addition, some of these rapidly expanding biological databases are updated on a regular basis. Pattern searches can be improved by using high-speed pattern matching algorithms. Researchers are striving to improve solutions in numerous areas of computational bioinformatics as biological data grows exponentially. Faster algorithms with a low error rate are needed in real-world applications. As a result, this study offers two pattern matching algorithms that were created to help speed up DNA sequence pattern searches. The strategies recommended improve performance by utilizing word-level processing rather than character-level processing, which has been used in previous research studies. In terms of time cost, the proposed algorithms (EFLPM and EPAPM) increased performance by leveraging word-level processing with large pattern size. The experimental results show that the proposed methods are faster than other algorithms for short and long patterns. As a result, the EFLPM algorithm is 54{\%} faster than the FLPM method, while the EPAPM algorithm is 39{\%} faster than the PAPM method.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is a powerful technology to perform massive-scale and complex computing. It eliminates the need to maintain expensive computing hardware, dedicated space, and software. Massive growth in the scale of data or big data generated through cloud computing has been observed. Addressing big data is a challenging and time-demanding task that requires a large computational infrastructure to ensure successful data processing and analysis. The rise of big data in cloud computing is reviewed in this study. The definition, characteristics, and classification of big data along with some discussions on cloud computing are introduced. The relationship between big data and cloud computing, big data storage systems, and Hadoop technology are also discussed. Furthermore, research challenges are investigated, with focus on scalability, availability, data integrity, data transformation, data quality, data heterogeneity, privacy, legal and regulatory issues, and governance. Lastly, open research issues that require substantial research efforts are summarized.}
