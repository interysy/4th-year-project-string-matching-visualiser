# Meeting on 05/12/2023 - 1pm
All times are approximate.

Attendees: Gethin, Michal

## Progress Up To That Meeting

* analysed the survey results - summarised the changes that need to be made
* refactored drawing service
* been experimenting with having multiple canvases for the animation (separate canvas for preprocessing and searching) -  a lot of issues with this approach, so I am not sure if I will keep it
* implemented KMP and efficient border algorithms (no animation)

## Meeting Notes

* Supervisor said to focus on the exam first, if there is free time then work on the project
* Gethin said to focus on animation first - last occurrence table is important, as is KMP and its preprocessing steps
* Split disseration sections into seperate files to make it easy to navigate
* Intro for disseration is looking good, but background less so - reference pseudocode otherwise why have it? Use Gethin's examples from slides and reference for BM,KMP and Brute Force.
* Since I already have a few diagrams using latex, I should continue, if it takes too long we will think about switching


## Plan For Next Week
* focus on exam!
* Last occurrence table on seperate canvas
* KMP animation
