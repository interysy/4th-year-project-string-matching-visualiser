# Meeting on 07/11/2023 - 1pm
All times are approximate.

Attendees: Gethin, Michal

## Progress Up To That Meeting

* added code highlighting to pseudocode
* changed page layout (not ready yet)
* added a direct step-changing feature
* fixed restart bugs
* fixed the variable displayer component (redid how additional variables are exported from algorithms)
* resized animation

Basically took care of some bugs and stylistic elements so that the prototype can be evaluated without any major issues.

## Meeting Notes

* It is normal to not have a lot done in some weeks, the hackathon was something that every students needs to take part in
* Gethin proposes implementing an 'active window', which would be a feature that allows the user to only see currently active part of animation. This will help reach a flexible layout that also work for mobile devices.
* The current code highlighting is hard to see, perhaps remove the overflow?
* We have set up a meeting before I fly home, this is on the 11th of December at 12pm.
* Gethin is happy for me to take a break from coding and start writing up the first section of the dissertation.


## Plan For Next Week
* fix the bugs (negative step, animation not resizing, text not changing if replaced with text of the same length)
* style the webpage so it is ready for first evaluation (less than last week, only pseudocode really and small screen layout)
- rework the last occurrence table, so it has to highlight (not done last week, I am thinking this could be skipped for the evaluation)
* create a survey for evaluation and deploy the software in the current state (remove unimplemented pages)
* implement active window feature
