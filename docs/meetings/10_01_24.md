# Meeting on 10/01/2023 - 11am
All times are approximate.

Attendees: Gethin, Michal

## Progress Up To That Meeting


* Added smooth animations and the ability to toggle this functionality on and off
* Added ability to filter out preprocessing steps and the ability to toggle this functionality on and off
* Added a modal for containing all the options
* Added a legend for learning what the colours on the animation mean
* Added a resizeable canvas via a slider (not merged yet - might be added for AB-testing in evaluation)
* Added theme-switching functionality (light and dark theme)
* finished up KMP and efficient border algorithms and animations (with border algorithm being shown too)
* Added a centralise scroll functionality
* added testing to all services except the drawing service (still to do tests for components in the module)
* Added a bunch of documentation
* refactored the scroll to be infinite - allow for reuse across the application


## Meeting Notes

* The app looks good, pretty much finished and can start thinking about evaluation
* A-B testing for the slider feature would be good to do
* Realistically the evaluation will just be a survey, getting qualitative and quantitative data regarding how easy the app is to use and learn from
* Don't need to test the component using p5js library, especially if all that can be tested would be the specific calls, however unit tests for everything else should be done
* Look into full Boyer Moore and animating it (research to see how viable this would be!)
* Get started on the dissertation (refactor current)

## Plan For Next Week
* dissertation work on the sections discussed before Christmas
* finish refactoring and fixing bugs from the November evaluation
* research full Boyer Moore and determine whether it can be animated!
