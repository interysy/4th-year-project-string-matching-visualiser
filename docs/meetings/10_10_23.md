# Meeting on 10/10/2023 - 1pm
All times are approximate.

Attendees: Gethin, Michal

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- set up the deployment pipeline for package creation, aswell as a staging and development server
- created a kanban board for the project
- held the workshop and created user stories based on requirements identified
- created a final wireframe based on the requirements that I will aim to follow throughout development - subject to change with evaluations
- used HTMLCanvas for drawing - viable tactic for the project
- created a prototype of 3 of 4 main features that will be included, mainly : pseudocode walkthrough , command displayer , variable value displayer
- made an architecture diagram of what I want the project structure to be like -> includes obsever pattern and stragtegy pattern (a selective dependency injection based on url) (DEMO THIS)
- installed a css framework I am planning to use



## 13:01 - 13:15 - Discussion
Going over what I have done this week: Gethin says I am on track.
- requirements look all good, Gethin signed the ethics form 
- software structure looks good, but Gethin said it may be subject to change as development starts , add time to plan to account for this 
- current prototype looks good - need to however focus on the visualisation bit - explore libraries this week and attempt to implement brute force (showed prototype on staging environment)
- don't worry about extensibility of the code for the moment - this will come once the 3 base algorithms are implemented   


# Plan
- this week, focus on visualisation libraries - anime.js , HTML Canvas or other -> this is important as forms the basis of the product 
- refactor current protytpe - create builder for step object , fix up variable values and style the protype a little bit to make it easier to see what is happening (currently some components are overlapping)  
- start implementation of visualising the brute force algorithm !
