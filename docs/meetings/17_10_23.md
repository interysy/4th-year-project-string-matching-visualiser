# Meeting on 24/10/2023 - 1pm
All times are approximate.

Attendees: Gethin, Michal

## Progress Up To That Meeting

* implemented visualisation library
* brute force algorithm animation
* dependency injection for brute force

## Meeting Notes

* need to add midstep colouring to make it explicit that the algorithm is in the middle of a step (Gethin's suggestion)
* Gethin said that I shouldn't worry about deployment too much at this stage - I can just build it manually for now (might be worth getting rid of staging branch too if deployment on netlify is not viable due to size of visualisation library)


## Plan For Next Week
- refactor the drawing service and visualiser (might need refactoring and creating documentation of what the steps should look like)
- implement visualisation for the bm algorithm (this will include dependency injection and reset of p5js canvas)
