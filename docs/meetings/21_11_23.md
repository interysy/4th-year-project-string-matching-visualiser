# Meeting on 21/11/2023 - 1pm
All times are approximate.

Attendees: Gethin, Michal

## Progress Up To That Meeting

* wrote intro, motivation and general background of the dissertation
* started writing up the background - turns out it is really hard to explain KMP and BM in a simple manner for the reader

## Meeting Notes

* Survey for prototype does not have many responses yet. Gethin will attempt to get more responses from the 3rd year students.
* Send Gethin the dissertation for review after kmp finished
* Wait until doing any code, until the survey is finished and the dissertation is reviewed - focus on disseration if you have the time to do so.
* After enough responses, could consider refactoring code and making suggested changes.


## Plan For Next Week
* work more on dissertation
* promote the survey to maximise the amount of responses
* send gething dissertation for review
* once there are more responses (10-15) start implementing suggested changes
