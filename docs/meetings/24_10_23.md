# Meeting on 24/10/2023 - 1pm
All times are approximate.

Attendees: Gethin, Michal

## Progress Up To That Meeting

* playback functionality
* brute force algorithm animation
* bm algorithm animation (no last occurance table)
* dependency injection of correct algorithm upon page change

## Meeting Notes

* Gethin has thoughts about animation, but he is not the intended audience. He proposed to set up a workshop with some third years that are starting to learn these algorithms.
* loop bug was fixed by Gething (silly mistake from my side)


## Plan For Next Week
- implement pre-processing visualisation steps for BM
- fix bugs with dependency injection
- fix bugs with variable displayer - mainly additional variables not being displayed (loop through all additional and display - do not change value if no new value is passed across)
- style the webpage so it is ready for first evaluation!
