# Meeting on 26/09/2023 - 1pm
All times are approximate.

Attendees: Gethin, Michal

## Progress Up To That Meeting
- explored various ways to have code documentation - sphinx and compodoc , went with compodoc as it has better support for typescript and saves me having to use python as well as node
- created a pipeline for automatic wiki generation
- created a repository within initial project skeleton
- created a ci (auto testing and linting) , although this is not merged as I am working on a way to export code coverage to either the wiki or the readme
- learned about docker and what I could use for cd - leaning towards DigitalOcean (host images on the registry there and then push onto droplets)
- created initial wireframes of the project (what features I have ideas for, what I expect the project to look like on mobile and desktop)
- wrote 2 pages of the dissertation (intro , motivation (including research), some high level goals (this part needs changing))

## 13:00 - 13:01

Admin, greetings etc.
## 13:01 - 13:15 - Discussion
Going over what I have done this week: Gethin says I am on track.
- worth spending time on devops as it would be useful in the future , still early days in the project so can be afforded
- set up a workshop to analyse (great idea - add to chapter 1 of dissertation)
- finish chapter of dissertation for review - send prior to meeting
- on UI design, sliding window would be the best - consider this as Gethin's requirement for the workshop
- no meeting next week, as Gethin is on holiday -> make sure to have workshop and write dissertation (send results prior to end of next week)


# Plan
- hold workshop - develop requirements (what users want) - create user stories
- finish cd pipeline and dissertation pipeline
- create final wireframe based on requirements
- Explore visualisation libraries
- Possibly write dissertation chapter 2 - about requirements and the study that was held
- As Gethin is not here for next meeting - start setting up the project skeleton and start writing the code for the project
