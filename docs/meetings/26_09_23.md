Admin, greetings etc.
## 13:01 - 13:015 - Discussion
Going over what I have done this week: Gethin says I am on track.  
- worth spending time on devops as it would be useful in the future , still early days in the project so can be afforded
- set up a workshop to analyse (great idea - add to chapter 1 of dissertation)
- finish chapter of dissertation for review - send prior to meeting 
- on UI design, sliding window would be the best - consider this as Gethin's requirement for the workshop
- no meeting next week, as Gethin is on holiday -> make sure to have workshop and write dissertation (send results prior to end of next week)
