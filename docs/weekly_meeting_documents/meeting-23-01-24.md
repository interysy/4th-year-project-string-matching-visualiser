# Supervisor Meeting - 23/01/24

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- finished tests for brute force
- refactored brute force
- finished tests for bm
- refactored bm
- started refactoring kmp and testing
- finished tests for most components

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

Not quite got onto the research, but my test coverage has been much improved (25% to 70% ish). Going forward I think it would be wise to step off the tests and focus on other things. 
Although the progress is not a lot, I am quite happy as the testing has proven to be a challenge, especially when refactoring at the same time. 


## Questions 
- Is the plan for the week too large? or does it look reasonable, most things on there should not take too long

## Proposed Plan (more of a plan until first of February so 9 days from now)
- finish refactoring/tests for kmp
- research full boyer moore and animatate
- final touches (center the site content etc.)
- pseudocode visualiser changes
- create home and about page

 The plan is to pretty much wrap up the application, so that it is ready for the evaluation, so most of the things to do include final touches. Going forward I think it would be a good idea to put e.g. 2 hours a week aside to work on further testing - both unit and end to end to beef up the code coverage.
