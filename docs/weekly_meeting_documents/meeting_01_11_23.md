# Third Supervisor Meeting - 31/10/23

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- fixed all bugs with changing pages (dependency injection)
- fixed canvas resetting for p5js (instead of using global, now a local instance of p5 is used)
- implemented the pre-processing steps for BM (very brief)
- changed to code to use decorator pattern - this allows for ease of adding of new things to draw for the algorithm such as the pre-processing table

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

I have fixed the bugs and added initial pre-processing visualisation steps for BM. I have also changed the code to use the decorator pattern, which allows for ease of adding of new things to draw for the algorithm such as the pre-processing table. However I have not added any visual changes or fixed the variable displayer bug (but I know what is wrong with it and how to fix it).

Things from last week that will need doing:
- style the webpage so it is ready for first evaluation
- rework the last occurance table, so it has highlighting
- create a plan for the evaluation workshop!

## Questions
- how many participants should I get for the evaluation? i don't want to have too many,as it might be intimidating for participants to speak up
- how should I go about the evaluation? I was thinking of having a demonstration, then perhaps fo around the room and see what each individual thinks and how the animation can be improved.

## Proposed Plan
- style the webpage so it is ready for first evaluation!
- rework the last occurance table, so it has highlighting
- create a plan for the evaluation workshop and hold it
- add any changes to be identified at workshop to repository and start working on those
