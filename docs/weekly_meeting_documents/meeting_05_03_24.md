# Supervisor Meeting - 04/03/24

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- been getting people to do the survey
- wrote some more design and implementation
- read a hall of fame piece
- started making some changes based on what I could identify as being good in the hall of fame (below)
- changed the abstract to be past tense
- changed initial high-level requirements (been changed quite a lot)
- added a summary to the introduction
- added a line to explain that each algorithm is represented as an array (please check this)
- refactored existing products to take less space (placed advantages and disadvantages to the appendix and instead summarised)
- changed bits of design to be written in past tense (sounds kinda weird so needs to be checked over)


## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

Everything has been done in line with the plan.


## Questions
- please review 4.2 just quickly and tell me if the tense is appropriate (originally this was in the present tense, but it kinda seems weird in the past tense)
- should the requirements section be more detailed? e.g. specific requirements as opposed to user stories
- is the currently existing products section better? or is it better to have the full advantages + disadvantages in the main body of the text?
- tell me if my bit about text/pattern being arrays is fine
- is the presentation a video?
- what should be in the presentation?



## Proposed Plan
- address Gethin's comments
- finish up the implementation section
- change the design section to be past tense (if appropriate)
- start on the evaluation section
- my hope is to have the dissertation draft finished this week (besides the survey results - instead this will be a placeholder for now)
