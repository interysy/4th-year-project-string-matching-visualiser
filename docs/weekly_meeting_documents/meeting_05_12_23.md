# Supervisor Meeting - 05/12/23

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- closed and analysed the survey results - summarised the changes that need to be made
- refactored drawing service
- been experimenting with having multiple canvases for the animation (separate canvas for preprocessing and searching) -  a lot of issues with this approach, so I am not sure if I will keep it
- implemented KMP and efficient border algorithms (no animation)

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

I started to look at how to implement changes from the survey. I have started implementing KMP. Progress has not been great, as revision has taken up most of my time and the multi-canvas feature has been a pain to implement.


## Questions
- feel like I am faffing about, not sure what I should be prioritising.
- how much work should I be doing this week - I do have an exam Friday and a little bit of revision left to do

## Proposed Plan
- complete KMP
- rework the last occurrence table with a separate canvas
- start working on survey bugs
