# Supervisor Meeting - 23/01/24

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- finished the product! (I think)
- added about page
- added a tutorial
- fixed the layout (centralised and handles zooming in and out)
- handled any bugs encountered
- fix failing tests due to changes
- started looking at the dissertation again

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

I have managed to do the tasks of the highest priority, unfortunately, I did not get to the animations due to lack of time, however, I think given it is February now and I am happy with the project, I move my full focus onto dissertation and evaluation.


## Questions

- is there anything vital missing or that could be improved upon?
- is there anything that I should be doing now that I am not?
- is there anything I should watch out for when writing the dissertation?
- if I were to create sections for the dissertation now, would you be willing to look over and see if the structure makes sense (this would just be the headings, giving an idea of the flow)




## Proposed Plan
- create the survey for mass distribution
- refactor what I currently have in the first chapter of the dissertation
- write up the rest of the background and finalise the first chapter
- start setting up a usability study/focus group
