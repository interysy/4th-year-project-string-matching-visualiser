# Third Supervisor Meeting - 31/10/23

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- added code highlighting to pseudocode
- changed page layout (not ready yet)
- added a direct step-changing feature
- fixed restart bugs
- fixed the variable displayer component (redid how additional variables are exported from algorithms)
- resized animation

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

Unfortunately, I have not been able to get to the point where I am ready for evaluation. Although I am almost happy with the styling (only need to figure out what to do with the pseudocode box, while keeping it readable), I have found a few bugs that would overshadow the aims of the evaluation - to get feedback on the usefulness of the animation and supporting components.

Things from the last 2 weeks that will need doing:
- style the webpage so it is ready for first evaluation (pseudocode left)
- rework the last occurrence table, so it has to highlight (not done yet)
- create a plan for the evaluation workshop! (not done yet)


## Questions
- how important is the styling for this evaluation? I am not sure if I should spend more time on it or not - I have been trying to perfect the layout (without a colour scheme)
- should I do the last occurrence highlighting for the workshop/evaluation or not?
- ask regarding the pre-Christmas meeting, so can book a ticket back home
- if we leave the survey up for about a week, would it be okay for me to work on the first section of the dissertation? (during this I can also implement KMP which would be fairly simple hopefully and add occurrence table highlighting )
- do I need to be at graduation? (unrelated to project)

## Proposed Plan
- fix the bugs (negative step, animation not resizing, text not changing if replaced with text of the same length)
- style the webpage so it is ready for first evaluation (less than last week, only pseudocode really and small screen layout)
- rework the last occurrence table, so it has to highlight (not done last week, I am thinking this could be skipped for the evaluation)
- create a survey for evaluation and deploy the software in the current state (remove unimplemented pages)
- it would be great to leave the survey up for a week or so to maximise feedback, this will give me time to rework the occurrence table and do write up of the first section of the dissertation
