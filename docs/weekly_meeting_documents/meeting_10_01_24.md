- added theme switching functionality (light and dark theme)
- finished up kmp and efficient border algorithms and animations (with border algorithm being shown too)

- added testing to all services except the drawing service (still to do tests for components in the module)

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

I have completed most tasks I wanted over christmas. I am well under way for the refactoring of the code and adding tests (hopefully will finish this week). I was hoping to get some dissertation done , but unfortunately I couldn't quite do so.


## Questions
- review slider feature
- what else can I add
- I am planning to add another algorithm, which would you recommend (this would be after the refactoring)?


## Proposed Plan
- finish refactoring
- disseration work (refactor the first 2 sections that were meant to be done over christmas)
- start another algorithm
