# Third Supervisor Meeting - 10/10/23

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- set up the deployment pipeline for package creation, aswell as a staging and development server
- created a kanban board for the project
- held the workshop and created user stories based on requirements identified
- created a final wireframe based on the requirements that I will aim to follow throughout development - subject to change with evaluations
- used HTMLCanvas for drawing - viable tactic for the project
- created a prototype of 3 of 4 main features that will be included, mainly : pseudocode walkthrough , command displayer , variable value displayer
- made an architecture diagram of what I want the project structure to be like -> includes obsever pattern and stragtegy pattern (a selective dependency injection based on url) (DEMO THIS)
- installed a css framework I am planning to use


## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

[] Choose tech (hopefully at this meeting) - _1/2_
[] Set up a pipeline for auto disseration compilation and software build - _3/4 software build done, dissertation to be tackled later_
[*] Start drawing out structure - strategy and observer pattern - _done_
[*] hold workshop - develop requirements (what users want) - create user stories
[*] finish cd pipeline and dissertation pipeline - _dissertation pipeline on backlog due to not being required any time soon_
[*] create final wireframe based on requirements
[*] Explore visualisation libraries - _explored HTMLCanvas , tracers.js and anime.js, but a bit more work with anime.js is required to see if viable_
[] Possibly write dissertation chapter 2 - about requirements and the study that was held - _not done_

## Questions
- what do you think about the proposed structure.
- what do you think of the prototype
- what do you think of the wireframe
- what do you think of the plan

## Proposed Plan
- firstly clear up the current code - create a step builder, pseudcode parser and fix the variable values updating
- try out anime.js and consequently choose which tech will be used (HTMLCanvas or anime.js or perhaps another framework?)
- implement visualisation for brute force algorithm -> might take a bit longer as will need to create the animation service
