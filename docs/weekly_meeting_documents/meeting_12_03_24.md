# Supervisor Meeting - 12/03/24

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- been getting people to do the survey
- addressed all your suggestions besides one in the KMP subsection
- as I was addressing the comments I decided to read over and refactor anything I did not like (this took a long time)
- wrote a bit more of the implementation
- finished last bit of the documentation for the code


## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

Unfortunately I have not managed to get a first draft ready for the meeting. I have been working on the dissertation a lot, but the refactoring has taken up quite a bit of my time.


## Questions
- I have used a bit of code from external sources, how can I reference them correctly? So far I have added acknowledgements in the README and as a comment above the code.
- Moodle states that it is possible to have an in-person presentation, is this something you would be willing to do? (it means I have a bit more time to focus on the writing part of the dissertation as there will be no editing). If so when and would we need to book a room with a projector? Also would mean you can ask questions.
- Is adding extra packages to template allowed e.g. noitemsep, side by side figures etc.
- do you think it is worth keeping pseudocode for KMP, it isnâ€™t referenced much due to complexity and explanations are based on visual figures
- I think it would be useful to get yourself and perhaps David Manlove to complete the survey, as the product can be used as a teaching tool - do you think this would be viable.
- is there anything so far in the dissertation I am missing that would be good to include (I saw your comment on including UI in the implementation section, I will add this in, but besides that?)
- try and get a few more survey responses (currently at 15)

## Proposed Plan

- refactor rest of implementation
- finish up the implementatiojn
- address new suggestions
- start and finish the evaluation section

My plan is to have a draft ready for the end of this week, do you think you would have time to go over it before net week, so that I have the weekend to make changes?
