# Supervisor Meeting - 13/02/24

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- refactored the intro and abstract of the dissertation
- refactored the background on algorithms and also wrote a section on existing products
- started writing the design (very briefly)
- started merging the "resizeable div" feature for A-B testing
- started the survey for the evaluation
- look into assigning keys to specific features for accessibility (last thing)

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

The plan was to write the dissertation and design the evaluation. I think I have made great progress on the dissertation, however, I am struggling to design the survey (I am also having a bit of trouble integrating the old feature back into the codebase). I haven't yet started looking into setting up a usability study...


## Questions

- I have left the survey so late, as I am unsure whether it is enough as a medium - what kind of questions do I need?


## Proposed Plan
- merge the feature
- setup the survey and distribute it by the end of the week
- continue with dissertation writing
- design usability study by the end of the week
