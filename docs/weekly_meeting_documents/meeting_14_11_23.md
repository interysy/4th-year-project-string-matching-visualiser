# Third Supervisor Meeting - 31/10/23

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- reworked the layout (added a mobile layout)
- implemented the active window view
- implemented animation resize functionality
- implemented simple last occurance highlighting functionality
- fixed various bugs sucvh as negative step
- create an evaluation survey
- deployed the software in the current state (removed unimplemented pages)

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

Everything from last week has been completed, although it is important to highlight I have left the pseudocode visualiser as is, since I got feedback from some people that they prefer having the overflow. Consequently I have added it as a question in the survey.


## Questions
- is there anything in the software itself that I am missing for the evaluation or are we ready to go?


## Proposed Plan
- SIGN ETHICS FORM
- write chapter 1 of dissertation while waiting for prototype feedback
- start implementing KMP algorithm (no animations, this should be fairly simple)
