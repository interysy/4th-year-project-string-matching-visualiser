# Supervisor Meeting - 05/12/23

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- done some more refactoring and testing (but not a lot)

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

Not done much, unfortunately. There is still stuff to refactor and research on full Boyer Moore has not been started.
I have struggled quite a lot with some testing and at the moment my code on the refactoring branch is broken due to this.

## Questions


## Proposed Plan
- continue with refactoring, testing and documentation (I plan to finish this this week)
- research full BM, start implementation
