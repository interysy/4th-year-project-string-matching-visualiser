# Supervisor Meeting - 21/11/23

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- wrote intro and motivation of the dissertation
- started writing up the background - turns out it is really hard to explain KMP and BM in a simple manner for the reader

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

The plan was to finish the whole chapter, however I have not had a lot of time to do this and I am still struggling with the background section. I am far from finishing the first chapter...


## Questions
- can you review what I have so far
- what else can I do to promote my survey. I only have 4-5 responses.

## Proposed Plan
- my aim is to finish the background on algorithms with any of your suggestions
- start working on changes from the survey (wait a few more days until a few more responses come in)
- not sure
