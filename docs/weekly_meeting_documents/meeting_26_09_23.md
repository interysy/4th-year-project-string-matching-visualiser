# First Meeting With Supervisor After Preliminary - 26/09/23 
  
## What Have I Done So Far?  
- explored various ways to have code documentation - sphinx and compodoc , went with compodoc as it has better support for typescript and saves me having to use python as well as node 
- created a pipeline for automatic wiki generation 
- created a repository within initial project skeleton 
- created a ci (auto testing and linting) , although this is not merged as I am working on a way to export code coverage to either the wiki or the readme 
- learned about docker and what I could use for cd - leaning towards DigitalOcean (host images on the registry there and then push onto droplets) 
- created initial wireframes of the project (what features I have ideas for, what I expect the project to look like on mobile and desktop) 
- wrote 2 pages of the dissertatin (intro , motivation (including research), some high level goals (this part needs changing))  
 
## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done
[*] Set up repo (once VCS confirmed) 
[] Choose tech (hopefully at this meeting) - _1/2 I know what framework but not sure about visualisation_ library as of yet
[] Set up a pipeline for auto disseration compilation and software build - _1/2 done for wiki gen and testing_
[*] Put current plan in trello - _using github projects to keep everything in one place_ 
[*] Wireframes for initial plan  
[*] Set up dissertation and reference manager software - _no need for refernce manager as won't be many_
[*] Create skeleton of the project 
[] Start drawing out structure - strategy and observer pattern - _not started_
 
## Questions 
- I feel like I have been kinda lost - not entirely sure what should I be focusing on - are my current actions appropriate for the first week of the project  
- have I been spending too much time on devops 
- what do you think my focus should be over the next week - would it be exploring visualisation libraries or starting to code 
- do you think it is appropriate to hold requirement gathering workshop?  
 
## Proposed Plan 
- hold workshop - develop requirements (what users want) - create user stories 
- finish cd pipeline and dissertation pipeline 
- create final wireframe based on requirements 
- Explore visualisation libraries 
- Possibly write dissertation chapter 2 - about requirements and the study that was held
