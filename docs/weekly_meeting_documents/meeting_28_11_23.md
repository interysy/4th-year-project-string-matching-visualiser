# Supervisor Meeting - 28/11/23

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- wrote background about algorithms in the dissertation
- learned about unit testing in angular
- written unit tests for bits of angular app (all pages, navbar, parser service)
- been promoting the survey - double the responses from last time (although not great!)

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

I have finished the first section of the background, but still have the analysis of existing solutios and write up of the requirement gathering workshop left.


## Questions
- i feel like I have slowed down quite a lot recently, not fully sure what I should be doing...

## Proposed Plan
- i think it would be best to refactor the background based on feedback from you, then hopefully write up the analysis of other solutions (I have done this before - just needs putting into latex) + workshop
- handle any suggestions from the survey (while at it - add documentation and refactor)
- start KMP implementation
