# Supervisor Meeting - 23/01/24

## What Have I Done Since Last Meeting?
- finished tests
- created home page for the site
- done research on full boyer moore algorithm
- attempted to implement the full boyer moore algorithm (some steps done - not all)
- found a new library to use with pseudocode visualiser (should this fail, I will fall back on self implementing this)

## Plan From Last Week and What Has Been Therefore Done

Managed to start most of the tasks agreed for this week. Refactoring and testing for the algorithms has been done, along with some of the final application touches (including creation of the home page according tot the wireframe).


## Questions
- I don't understand how the algorithm for the good suffix rule works
- The full boyer moore implementation is likely to take a few days (animating the preprocessing steps, determining whether good suffix rule or bad character rule has been used are the main "risks"). Is it worth going forward with attempting to implement (this will likely go into next week, possibly even longer)
- Would it be useful to include a tutorial to increase ease of use (a couple of popups within different buttons etc.)


## Proposed Plan
- pseudocode visualiser (highest priority)
- about page ((second highest prioerity)should not take too long - will simply contain a body of text saying what the project is about and links)
- plan evaluation (highest priority)
- full boyer moore (maybe? - extended amount of time necessary)
- thinking of adding some animations to whole site (mainly just things fading in on load - low priority - if time allows)
- start looking at dissertation again (from Monday onwards)
